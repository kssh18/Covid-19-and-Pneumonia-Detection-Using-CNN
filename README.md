Chest X-rays helps us to find out the affected areas in the lungs.
Using chest X-ray pictures, the project aimed to construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that will aid in the early detection of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients during the pandemic’s challenging time. As described, two convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained and implemented on two distinct datasets; one for "Covid -19" detection and the other one for "Pneumonia"

## Covid - 19

The dataset is sourced from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mr3suvhro/covid-19-xray-image-dataset-with-huge-samples?select=COVID" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> "COVID 19 Xray Image Dataset with Huge Samples" </a> from Kaggle - a known platform for having good variety of datasets for machine learning models. This dataset is a medical dataset of X-Ray Report of various patients. It consists of nearly xray images of nearly 2328 patients' records.

## Pneumonia

### Dataset - Pneumonia

The dataset is taken from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia" style="text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"> "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" </a> from Kaggle. The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
